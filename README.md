# 🧠 Performance Evaluation of ML and DL Approaches for Early Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder and Development of Autistic Care Hub

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a **comprehensive comparative study of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models** for the **early diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** using behavioral and demographic data derived from AQ-10 screening tests. Based on the best-performing model, a **web-based Autism Care Hub** was developed to support early screening, diagnosis assistance, and continuous monitoring.

The work focuses on identifying the most reliable algorithms for ASD prediction while emphasizing the importance of **behavioral features over demographic attributes**.
